Neonatal Suction Device
slide-1 : name of proj, team
slide-2 : top-a microcontroller based automated suction device that can expel viral secretion from a baby's (1-30 days) chest/wind pipe to avoid choking
          scope of work- 1. android app for filling the patient details and operational paramaters such as frequency, duration of suction etc(app video)
                         2. interface and build controller logic to read pressure(back pressure) & vacuum(suction manifold) sensors and control suction pump and valves
